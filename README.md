# hackerrank-counting-valleys
From the hackerrank challenge "Counting Valleys". A hiker keeps track of how many steps were taken in a hike from sea level back to sea level again. The number of steps are accounted for along with the each path taken indicated by "D" for downhill or "U" for uphill. The function returns how many valleys the hiker encountered on the hike.
